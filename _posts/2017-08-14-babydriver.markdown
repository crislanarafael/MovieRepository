**Directed by: Edgar Wright**
**Starring: Jamie Foxx, John Hamm, Kevin Spacey**

When I first saw the theatrical trailer for Baby Driver, I knew that it would easily be one of my favorite movies of 2017. I mean how could it not? It's created by Edgar Wright, one of my favorite directors. It's an action comedy, one of my favorite genres. And it boasts an interesting stylistic element. In this case, it's the synchronization of music and sound. It's always great to watch a movie with a great story and cast of characters, but I think it's a treat when we're presented with an interesting concept that forms the basis of said story.

Sound is heavily used in most modern movies. It can be used to create expectations, emphasize scenarios, and describe characters and/or their state of mind for example.
