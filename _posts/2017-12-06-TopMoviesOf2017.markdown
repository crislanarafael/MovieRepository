2017 has been a really good year for movies. There were so many movies that I really looked forward to seeing as well as many movies that I didn't plan on seeing/haven't heard of that took me by surprise. I initially planned on a top 10 list, but the staggering amount of films that I really enjoyed wouldn't make the cut. That by itself should definitely give you a sense of how great this year was!

So after much deliberation I've come up with my Top 20 of 2017. This list is the result of careful analysis of all movies released this year, a lot of discussion, and sleepless nights ranking and creating criteria. 


1. Dunkirk
2. Another Wolfcop
3. The Void
4. Bon Cop Bad Cop 2
5. Guardians of the Galaxy
6. Blade Runner 2049
7. Thor: Ragnarok
8. Wonder Woman
9. Spiderman Homecoming
10. Your name
11. Baby Driver
12. Logan
13. Kingsman the golden circle
14. It
15. John Wick 2
16. Wind River
17. Atomic Blonde
18. Logan Lucky
19. American made
20. The Foreigner
