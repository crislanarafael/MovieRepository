I'll be honest. Detroit wasn't my first choice. But with the august long weekend coupled with a thick blanket of haze that made it disgusting to stay outside (August heat is already disgusting enough), people scrambled into the theatres in droves. I had to make a snap judgement. I had my eye on seeing the box office bomb Valerian, but with the theatre lobby almost up to capacity I had to make a smarter choice. What kind of movie would people NOT see in the summer? Any superhero/Marvel movie was out of the question. There's no way you could pay me to see cold corporate shill that is the Emoji movie. No way I was going to see Dunkirk especially today of all days. I know! People won't want to see a movie that wasn't heavily promoted, about racial tensions
