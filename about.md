> The only opinion that matters is my own

This is a page about movies and my brain dumpings about movies. The idea behind the madness was conceived by partly boredom, and mostly desperation to stay away from summer heat. To this day I still don't know what it is that people love about summer. I've essentially been living, nay, retreating into movie theatres these days. Basking in the dark air-conditioned environment, and watching almost everything being released. This page is what I have to show for it.
